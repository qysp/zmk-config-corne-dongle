# Corne ZMK

Personal ZMK config for a [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) variant from [Typeractive](https://github.com/typeractivexyz).

Instead of having a master keyboard half which communicates with the computer, a dongle (Seeed Xiao BLE) is used which drastically increases the battery life.

## Installation

1. Copy the settings reset firmware onto the dongle and each keyboard half, respectively.
2. Copy the actual firmware onto the left & right keyboard half and turn them on.
3. Copy the actual firmware onto the dongle.
4. If the keyboard halves do not automatically connect to the dongle, use the reset button.
